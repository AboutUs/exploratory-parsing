Utility Shell Scripts
=====================

The scripts in this directory are used to prepare for or clean up from exploratory parsing.
They are not called by the server.

These scripts are written to be executed from the enclosing directory, _exploratory-parsing_.
Typically this is from the command-line shell with a command of the form:

	sh scripts/<script-name>.sh

We do not follow the convention of making scripts executable.
